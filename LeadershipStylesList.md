7. **Charismatic Leadership**: This style relies heavily on the charm and persuasiveness of the leader. Charismatic leaders are driven by their convictions and commitment to their cause.

8. **Situational Leadership**: This style proposes that no single leadership model is best. Instead, it all depends on the situation at hand and which type of leadership and strategies are best suited to the task.
